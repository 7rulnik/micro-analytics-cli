/**
 * NOTE (@mxstbr): This is super hacky.
 *
 * Due to a bug upstream in jest-haste-map no tests that contain node_modules anywhere in their path
 * can be run, not even explicitly. When this is installed the tests we want to run are in
 * node_modules/micro-analytics-cli/tests/ â€” see the problem?
 *
 * We circumvent this bug by npm linking the adapter, cloning the whole micro-analytics project to
 * /tmp/, installing the dependencies, running the tests with the adapter and then deleting the
 * temp folder again.
 *
 * I know, I know. I really want to ship this though. (16th January, '17)
