# `micro-analytics`

Public analytics as a Node.js microservice.

With less than 100 lines of code this service is the smallest analytics you'll ever need. It does nothing except count the views of something and making the views accessible via an API.

(there is currently no frontend to display pretty graphs, feel free to build one!)

## Built with

- [`micro`](https://github.com/zeit/micro) to create the service.
- [`flat-file-db`](https://github.com/mafintosh/flat-file-db) to store the data. (and [`promise`](https://github.com/then/promise) to promisify `flat-file-db`)

## Setup

1. `git clone git@github.com:mxstbr/micro-analytics` to get the repo.
2. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. `npm start` to start the service.

And that's it! üéâ (see [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md) for deployment instructions)

## Usage

### Tracking views

To track a view, simply send a request to `/<yourpath>`. If you send a `GET` request, the request will increment the views and return the total views. If you send a `POST` request, the views will increment but you don't get the total views back.

This is how you'd track pageviews for a website: (though note that this can be used to track anything you want)

```HTML
<script>
  fetch('servicedomain.com' + window.location.pathname)
    // Log total pageviews for current page to console
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json.views))
    .catch(err => console.log('Something went wrong:', err))
</script>
```

If you just want to get the views for a path and don't want to increment the views during a `GET` request, set `inc` to `false` in your query parameter. (`/<yourpath>?inc=false`)

If you want to get all views for all paths, set the `all` query parameter to `true`. (`/?all=true`)

## Contributing

If you run `npm run dev` the server will restart every time you edit the code. Perfect for development of `micro-analytics`!
